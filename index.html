          <p>Pain is one of the most distressing symptom in cancer and various other chronic illnesses,
            and takes a very heavy toll on the patient and their families.
            My primary aim is to alleviate the pain and suffering arising out of such illnesses and provide
            a holistic care plan to the seriously ill patients and their families by addressing the physical,
            emotional and spiritual aspects of their pain.</p>

           <p>In the field of care there are no standardisations. Which is why I personally formulate
              the health care strategy for each patient myself, in consultation with experts from
              required fields. This personalisation ensures that you and your loved ones receive
              the best health care support at all times.
              In my journey as a doctor I was moved by the serious health related sufferings.
              Which is why I am committed to providing care to general patients and elderly in the
              comfort of their homes. My specialisation in Pain, Palliative Care and Geriatric
              Medicine helps me bridge the gap between cure and care, and provide a continuum
              of health care to people diagnosed with serious illnesses. I have a team of trained,
              experienced, competent and polite professionals on board with me to support the
              patients and their families struggling with serious health related issues.</p>

    <p class="comment"> After 20 years of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease and at the age of 75 years, having suffered a second stroke,
                        the decision of whether to hospitalise or go in for palliative care for my husband became a lot easier
                        after meeting with Dr. Mona Rai. In my initial meeting with her, she gave ample time to understand my husbandâ€™s
                        current and past condition, understand what are our wishes as a family, chart a clear course of what will be done
                        from here on and an explanation of the medical services offered. In the coming days, she provided timely assistance
                        either in the form of prescribing medicines to ease my husbandâ€™s suffering or when needed sending a nurse or even at
                        the time of certifying the death of my husband. Her humane professional approach is what I and my son were looking for
                        in a palliative care doctor.Thank you Dr. Mona Rai for helping us as a family give the right care to my husband.</p>
